- User can enter multiple emails separated by commas or spaces or semicolon

- As the user types/ pastes a valid email followed by a comma or space or semincolon convert it to a tag.

- Add a space and move cursor to the right so that the user can type another email.

- Each tag should have a cross to remove the entered email. One can also remove an entire email tag by hitting Backspace.

- if it's invalid and user enters a comma then highlight the tag in red text

- If the user pastes an email address, trim leading and trailing spaces in the email.

- If the user pastes multiple email addresses in either of these formats it should convert to individual tags: 
-String 1: Abhishek Barua <abhishek.barua@cactusglobal.com>; Abhitesh Das <abhiteshd@cactusglobal.com>; Allan Mascarenhas <allanm@cactusglobal.com>; Amit Bhatia <amit.bhatia@cactusglobal.com>; Aneesha Jaisheel <aneeshaj@cactusglobal.com>; Dhanashri Adsul <dhanashria@cactusglobal.com>; Hetal Negi <hetal.negi@cactusglobal.com>;
- String 2: abhishek.barua@cactusglobal.com; abhiteshd@cactusglobal.com; allanm@cactusglobal.com; 


If the user double clicks into an email tag, then convert it to text so that it can be edited. When converted to text, don't include comma.

- Since tags take up additional space, when the user focuses out of the CC or BCC field the emails can be converted to text with comma separators 
- Example: john.doe@mailinator.com, jane.doe@mailinator.com

- If user focuses back into the Cc or Bcc field, then convert emails to tags 

 If user clicks on to an email tag, apply selected class so that user can copy past (Ctl + C)
X> If user clicks on to an email tag, apply selected class so that user can copy past (right click copy)

If focus is in the field and user clicks on Ctrl + A then all emails can be selected

When pasting multiple emails they should in the standard text format
Example: john.doe@mailinator.com, jane.doe@mailinator.com
